# Design Notes
## Chris meeting (9/4/20)
* Started with Arduino install - no drivers needed
* Blink example - tweak delays
* New LED:  pinMode & digitalWrite
* #defines and the pre-processor
* Serial.prints
* variables - global.  type, name, initializer
* Control structures:while,if,for
* Functions & parameters
* stack frames! 
* sticky point:  name of the parameter vs name in the "calling" context.

## Future:
Already have a good pointer explanation, but need to build the basics.
Same for Class.
Same for Library.
